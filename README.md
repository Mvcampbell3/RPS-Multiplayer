# RPS-Multiplayer

### Version 2.00

- Outputs result of game to page
- Resets game after each round
- Can only play game if logged in

### Issues
- OnDisconnect it a mystery to me
- If closes browser before logout, ruins game

### Version 1.50

- Authentication is borderline complete, need to work on .onDisconnect
- Game runs well
- Need to output results to page
- Need to implement chat

### Version 1.00

I have added the files that are going to be used. I have also put together a basic styling and pretty much all of the HTML.
Work on the js file now begins.
